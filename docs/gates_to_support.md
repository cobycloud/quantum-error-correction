# Future Gate Support
- Hadamard Gate (H): It creates superposition and is often used in quantum algorithms.
- Y (Pauli-Y) Gate: It is another Pauli gate similar to X and Z.
- S and S† Gates: They are phase gates that introduce a phase shift.
- T and T† Gates: They are also phase gates and are sometimes referred to as "pi/8 gates."
- RX, RY, and RZ Gates: Rotation gates around the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively.
- SWAP Gate: Swaps the states of two qubits.
- Toffoli Gate: A three-qubit gate that performs a classical AND operation.
- Fredkin Gate: A three-qubit gate that swaps the second and third qubits based on the state of the first qubit.
- U3 Gate: A general single-qubit unitary gate.
