# Quantum Error Correction Library Design Document

## Overview

The Quantum Error Correction Library is designed to simulate quantum error correction using the surface code. The library leverages NetworkX for graph representation, NumPy for numerical operations, and SciPy for matrix exponentiation.

## Class Structure

### SurfaceCodeQubit

The `SurfaceCodeQubit` class is the core component of the library, representing a logical qubit in a surface code. It includes methods for applying quantum gates (`X`, `Z`, `CNOT`), measuring stabilizers, detecting errors, and correcting errors.

### Initialization

- The logical qubits are initialized as a 2D array with small complex values to avoid numerical issues.

### Quantum Gates

- The class supports the application of X, Z, and CNOT gates to the logical qubits.
#### X Gate ('X')

The X gate, also known as the bit-flip gate, is applied to a target qubit, causing a flip in its state. This gate is implemented by multiplying the logical qubit's state with the Pauli-X gate matrix.

#### Z Gate ('Z')

The Z gate, also known as the phase-flip gate, is applied to a target qubit, introducing a phase flip in its state. This gate is implemented by multiplying the logical qubit's state with the Pauli-Z gate matrix.

#### CNOT Gate ('CNOT')

The CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate is a two-qubit gate that flips the target qubit if the control qubit is in the state |1‚ü©. This gate is implemented by multiplying the logical qubit's state with a specific CNOT matrix.

### Error Detection and Correction

- The library simulates error detection using stabilizer measurements, and it implements error correction strategies based on detected syndromes.

#### Stabilizer Measurement
The library simulates error detection by measuring stabilizers, which are products of logical qubit states in specific patterns. The measure_stabilizers method iterates over graph nodes, computes stabilizer values, and introduces random errors based on the stabilizer values.

#### Error Correction
The error correction process involves identifying and correcting errors based on detected syndromes. The _correct_error method is responsible for applying more sophisticated error correction techniques. Currently, the _apply_correction method applies corrections based on detected syndromes.

The _apply_correction method checks if a syndrome is detected and applies a correction strategy. In the current example, it randomly chooses between X and Z corrections.

#### Measurement and State Retrieval

- The library allows measuring the state of specific qubits and retrieving the state vector of the logical qubits.

##### Measurement Method
The measure method uses the probabilities of the logical qubits' states to perform a simulated quantum measurement.

#### State Retrieval Method
The get_state_vector method flattens the 2D array representing logical qubits into a 1D array to create the state vector.

## Error Correction Strategy

The error correction strategy involves:
1. Measuring stabilizers to detect syndromes.
2. Identifying errors based on syndromes.
3. Applying appropriate corrections (X, Z) to mitigate detected errors.

## Future Enhancements

The library can be extended to include more sophisticated error correction techniques and support additional gate types.

## Example Usage

```python
size = 3
surface_code_qubit = SurfaceCodeQubit(size)
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('X', [(0, 0), (0, 1)])
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('Z', [(1, 1), (2, 2)])
syndromes = surface_code_qubit.measure_stabilizers()
surface_code_qubit.correct_errors(syndromes)
state_vector = surface_code_qubit.get_state_vector()
```
## Conclusion

The Quantum Error Correction Library provides a foundation for simulating quantum error correction using the surface code. Users can experiment with gate operations, error detection, and correction strategies.
