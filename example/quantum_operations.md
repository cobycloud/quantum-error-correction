### Simple Quantum Circuit

#### Operations:
1. Apply Hadamard gate (H) to a qubit.
2. Apply CNOT gate between qubits.
3. Measure the qubits.

#### Purpose:
1. Create superposition with the Hadamard gate.
2. Entangle qubits with the CNOT gate.
3. Perform a measurement to obtain classical information.

#### Code:
```python
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('H', [(0, 0)])
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('CNOT', [(0, 0), (0, 1)])
surface_code_qubit.measure([(0, 0), (0, 1)])
```

### Entanglement Creation

#### Operations:
1. Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
2. Apply CNOT gate between the first and second qubits.
3. Measure both qubits.

#### Purpose:
1. Create an entangled state between two qubits.
2. Observe quantum entanglement through measurements.

#### Code:
```python
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('H', [(0, 0)])
surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('CNOT', [(0, 0), (0, 1)])
surface_code_qubit.measure([(0, 0), (0, 1)])

for _ in range(num_rounds):
    surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('H', syndrome_qubits)
    surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('CNOT', [(syndrome_qubits[i], data_qubits[i]) for i in range(size)])

num_steps = 5  # Adjust as needed
rotation_angle = 0.2  # Adjust as needed
for step in range(num_steps):
    for qubit in range(size):
        surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('H', [(qubit, 0)])
        for target_qubit in range(size):
            if target_qubit != qubit:
                surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('CPHASE', [(qubit, 0), (target_qubit, 0)])
        surface_code_qubit.apply_gate('RX', [(qubit, 0)], angle=rotation_angle)
    surface_code_qubit.measure([(0, 0)])
